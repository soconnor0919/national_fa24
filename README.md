# Bucknell Chem-E-Car Control System Code
This is the code for the 2024 National Chem-E-Car competition, at the AIChE Annual Student Conference in San Diego, CA.

## Description
This repository contains the code for the 2024 Bucknell Chem-E-Car Control System. The Chem-E-Car is a chemical-powered car that is designed to compete in the annual AIChE Chem-E-Car competition. The competition involves designing and building a car that is powered and stopped by a chemical reaction and can stop at a predetermined distance.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Control System Code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/chemecar2024.git`
2. Open the `chemecar2024.ino` file in your Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage
The `chemecar2024.ino` file contains the main code for the Control System. It includes the necessary functions and logic to control the car's movements and perform the required tasks. You can modify the code to customize the behavior of the car or add new features.
